# Mini-Photoshop

This is a replica of photoshop applications widely used now-a-days. This project is developed upon only some of the very important features for image manipulation. Following are the image manipulation features being implemented through their respective techniques in our project-
* Vignette
* Grayscale
* Flipping
	* Vertical Flip
	* Horizontal Flip
* Edge Detection
* Solarization
* Brightness Control
* Contrast Control
* Blur

## User GUI

As a user of the application, you can upload images from your PC or Laptop into the application for manipulation. Once uploaded, you can click the preview button every time you edit in order to view the manipulated image. There are buttons for some features and a scroller for others (like brightness, contrast, blur, etc) for which you can select the level for edits of those properties. At the bottom of the application, you would see the status bar which would show the progress level of your edit (in %), which on completion will indicate *ready*. At the end, once you get your desirable manipulated image, you can export it to whatever directory you want in your device.
